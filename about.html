            <p>...but you also go as PHI.</p>
            <p>You are a SOCIAL RECLUSE who has a penchant for technology, website designs and the old but never forgotten EARLY INTERNET CULTURE. Due to your mood swings, however, you always end up WITHDRAWING from people entirely periodically which are one of the few TRAITS your friends have trouble keeping up with. Because of your TIMEZONE which places you in the northern hemisphere, haphazardly changing SLEEP SCHEDULE influenced by INSOMNIA at times and an INDOORS lifestyle, most people have trouble getting in CONTACT with you. </p>
            <p>With all the mopey stuff aside, you can fluently speak 3 LANGUAGES due to your upbringing. You are currently around but not quite <i><u><span title="20">9 SOLAR SWEEPS</i></u></span> old. </p>
